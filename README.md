# Logidroid
A FOSS logic gate simulator for Android [WIP]

## What is Logidroid?
Logidroid is a [WIP] FOSS logic gate simulator for Android. It is currently in its early development/planning phase.

## Inspiration

I am currently reading a book about how a computer works internally, and they go on to talk about logic gates. 

A couple of days ago I looked online and found some interesting logic gate simulators. 

I thought it would be a fun challenge to create a similiar app of my own that's free and open source -- made for Android.
